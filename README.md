# Text-Classification-With-BERT

## <aligne = 'justify'>I did text classification based on transformers(BERT) in 21 categories. The main dataset in [THIS LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/code/naifislam/resume-categorization/input?select=data) has 24 categories in 2484 resumes, but for augmentain and increasing dataset, I did translation and replacement augmentation. Now our dataset is 7451 resumes. 3 categories by name 'BPO', 'AGRICULTURE' and 'AUTOMOBILE' has the lower frequency, so i deleted those.
